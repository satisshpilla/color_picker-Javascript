# color_picker-Javascript

A basic Javascript project for beginners who came forward and started learning JavaScript.

This Project includes all the basic concepts of JavaScript. 

**#color_picker** is developed using HTML, CSS, JS. It also includes some basic CSS Animations for Sliders.

I haven't used any PNG or SVG in this project. I have used Icons imported from Fontawesome Icons.

You can get them by adding an API link embedded in a HTML tag. https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome

For Icons navigate to https://fontawesome.com/icons

Add an API to scale colors. That API is located at https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/
